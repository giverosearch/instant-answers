# Instant Answers

This repository contains the source code for the Instant Answer modules used on www.givero.com. 

We have adopted the first IAs from DuckDuckGo (https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies) and plan to port more of their IAs to Givero in the future.

## Suggest an IA
Please submit an issue with the IA you'd like to see added to Givero and let us know if you'd like to assist with porting it from DDG.

## Testing IAs
We don't have a test framework as such yet, but we display the IAs in iframes on Givero, so you can view them directly in e.g. Apache. Simply install Apache and clone the repository in the document folder, and you can try out the IAs by accessing e.g. /instant-answers/timer/index.html
